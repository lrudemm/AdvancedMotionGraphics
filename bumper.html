				<p>15 second Bumper for the ASP, now known as the WSL since they rebranded a few years ago. This is the organization who run all professional surfing contests around the world. I redrew the logo in Adobe Illustrator and animated in After Effects along with a few layers I had to recreate in After Effects. I hope you enjoy.</p>
